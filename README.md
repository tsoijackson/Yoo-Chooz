Yoo-Chooz is a full stack web development project to help a group of friends and co-workers decide where to eat out. The project is named Yoo-Chooz because "You choose" was a common phrase used between my friends when deciding where to eat.

Visit [Yelp](https://www.yelp.com) and copy multiple business urls into Yoo-Chooz. Then click the Chooz button and a random place from the list will be chosen.
